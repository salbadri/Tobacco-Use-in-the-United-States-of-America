# Tobacco Use in the United States of America


# Project Name
Tobacco Use in the United States of America (1995 -2010)
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore how tobacco use in the United States has changed over time, and how tobacco use varies by state and by region.

## Project Description

*The goal of this project is to explore trends in Tobacco in the United States of America

* [Dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/tobacco-use) was retrieved from Kaggle. I focused on the United States of America only; I filtered out the rest. 

* Smoking behavior divided into four categories: Smoke everyday, Smoke some days ( I renamed it to Occasional smoker),Former Smoker, and  never smoked (I renamed it to Non smoker). 
* I explored tobacco smoking for each state over 15 years (1995 to 2010)
* I created I created smoking behavior indicator. If former smokers and smoke everyday higher than non smokers then it categories state(s) as having ‘high number of smokers’. If Occasional Smokers higher than former smokers and smoke everyday then it categories state(s) as mild ‘Smoke Some days. Lastly, if Non Smokers higher than former smokers and smoke everyday then it categories state(s) as Low number of Smokers. 
* Applying smoking behavior indicator showed that the states either have High number of smokers or Low number o smokers. 
* I used map to visualize change of tobacco use in each state over time (1995-2010). I applied smoking behavior indicator; high number of smokers (represented on the map as red cross) and low number of smokers (represented on the map as green check mark). 

* I divided states to four regions: Midwest, Northeast, South, and West.  I divided up states to regions based on the [Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States#5_Geographic_Regions)
* I plotted the four categories: Nonsmokers, Former smokers, smoke every day, and Occasional smoker.
for each region. 

* To further explore trends in tobacco use over time, I created smokers category by combining former smoker and smoke everyday. Then I plot smokers against non smokers using double axis graph. I synchronized the axis to check pattern  
 
* Pages: Years (1995 to 2010). 

## Observations:

* From the plot of “Trends of Non Smokers and Smokers in the United States” I observed that Tobacco use has declined and reached its lowest point in 2010. Smoking dropped significantly low in 2004. In 2005 increased comparing to 2004, but still lower than it was in the years btw 1995 -2003. Further analysis needed to explore why did it decrease significantly low in 2004 then picked up in 2005? And, why it reached its lowest point in 2010. Must investigate if this pattern is due to missing values in one or more of the categories. 
*  From the map where smoking behavior indicator applied, I observed more green arrows (decline in tobacco use with time). Just a reminder that the smoking behavior indicator infers if we have more smokers than smokers or vice versa for each state. 

* When we look at the plot of Smoking behavior for each region, we see that former smokers and smoke every day are higher in the south comparing to other regions. Also, I observed higher number of non-smokers present comparing to other regions. This can be due to having higher population in the south comparing to other regions.
