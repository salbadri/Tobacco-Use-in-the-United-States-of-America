## Project Description

### Goals
This project aims to uncover trends in tobacco use within the United States of America.

### Data Source
The primary dataset was obtained from Kaggle, focusing solely on the United States while excluding other regions.

### Smoking Behavior Categories
Smoking behavior was categorized into four groups: 
1. Smoke every day
2. Occasional smoker (formerly "Smoke some days")
3. Former smoker
4. Never smoked (formerly "Non-smoker")

### Analysis Highlights
- Examination of tobacco smoking patterns across all states over a 15-year period (1995 to 2010).
- Creation of a smoking behavior indicator, categorizing states as having a 'high number of smokers' if the sum of former smokers and daily smokers exceeds the number of non-smokers. Conversely, states with more occasional smokers than former and daily smokers are classified as 'Smoke Some Days,' while states with more non-smokers than former and daily smokers are labeled as having a 'Low number of Smokers.'
- Visualization of the temporal changes in tobacco use for each state (1995-2010) using a map, with high number of smokers represented as red crosses and low number of smokers as green checkmarks.
- Division of states into four regions (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) based on Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions.
- Plotting of the four smoking categories (Nonsmokers, Former smokers, Smoke every day, and Occasional smokers) for each region.
- Creation of a combined smokers category by aggregating former smokers and daily smokers, followed by plotting against non-smokers using a dual-axis graph with synchronized axes to identify patterns.

### Observations
- Analysis of the "Trends of Non-Smokers and Smokers in the United States" plot reveals a decline in tobacco use, reaching its lowest point in 2010. A significant drop is observed in 2004, followed by a slight increase in 2005 but remaining lower than the years between 1995 and 2003. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the significant decline in 2004 and the subsequent increase in 2005, possibly due to missing data in one or more categories.
- The smoking behavior indicator, when applied to the map, indicates a prevalence of green arrows (representing more non-smokers than smokers), emphasizing the ratio of smokers to non-smokers.
- Analysis of the smoking behavior for each region demonstrates that the South has a higher proportion of former smokers and daily smokers compared to other regions. Additionally, the South exhibits a higher number of non-smokers, potentially influenced by its larger population compared to other regions.

## Project Requirements
- Data exploration and descriptive statistics.
